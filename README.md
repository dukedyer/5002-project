### Project

**Problem statement - describe the problem that your project is trying to solve**
We seek to provide online visibility to the management of an airport. Airports have many job functions essential to their operation, Additionally, airports have a high volume of travelers that demand accurate, accesable data for their travel itenerary. Manual tracking of airport employees and passengers is an almost insurmountable task given the small margin of error that is required for record keeping.

**Solution statement - describe the solution you implemented to solve the problem**
Our solution creates a platform for accurate, relational record keeping for of passenger travel and employee job functions within an airport. Specifically, our domain model and web app allows for the creation of passengers, tickets, and planes. Additionally, airport/airplane employees can be given different roles (flight attendent, gate attendent, etc) and assigned job specific tasks. Essentially, our solution seeks to manage the functions within an airport and airplane.

**User - describe the typical user(s) that would use your solution**

**Domain objects - describe at least two of the domain objects you implemented in your solution**
